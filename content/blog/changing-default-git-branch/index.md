There's been talk of changing a Git repo's default branch, currently called "master."

You may say to yourself, "What a load of horse poo!" Or "I'll have to update my scripts/CI pipeline and that will take some man hours to do."

Fair.

But then if you are ready to change over, you may be wondering...

- What name do we choose for our new default branch? Main? Latest? Primary?
- What eldritch recipe or complex list of steps must we follow to do this?
- Will our project break?

Look, Scott Hanselman [has you covered](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/EasilyRenameYourGitDefaultBranchFromMasterToMain.aspx). It's maybe 30 seconds of work per repo.
