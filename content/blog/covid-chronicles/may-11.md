> [@DCHHS](https://twitter.com/DCHHS) reports 253 cases & 2 deaths. Today we tie for the most number of positive cases in Dallas County. **The last seven days have been flat. It’s too early to call this a plateau at the peak but that would be consistent with the medical models from early April** done... [pic.twitter.com/t5pJfBdcna](https://t.co/t5pJfBdcna)

This follows guidance from the federal Coronavirus Task Force, which recommends state health agencies test all nursing homes in the next 2 weeks.

> MORE: When asked whether losing the 1,000 daily [#COVID19](https://twitter.com/hashtag/COVID19?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) tests will impact the county and how that should be interpreted, [@JudgeClayJ](https://twitter.com/JudgeClayJ) said: “That’s an indication the feds are getting out of testing.”

Jason Whitely (@JasonWhitely) [May 11, 2020](https://twitter.com/JasonWhitely/status/1259966877322883074)

Seems like the burden of testing is shifting to the states. Not going to go politically in depth, but that's fine with me.

> .[@JudgeClayJ](https://twitter.com/JudgeClayJ) said there’s talk that [@GovAbbott](https://twitter.com/GovAbbott)’s “surge forces” to test large numbers of people will visit all four large counties in North Texas for two days in each places — focusing on ZIP codes where there are the most [#COVID19](https://twitter.com/hashtag/COVID19?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) cases.

This means every professional hockey league in North America except for the NHL has cancelled their season. This doesn't mean the NHL won't resume play, but it does make it look less likely.
