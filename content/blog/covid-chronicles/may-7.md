This morning, Governor Greg Abbott amended his executive order to stop jailing business owners who reopen their businesses ahead of schedule and violate local shelter-in-place orders. That includes local salon owner Shelley Luther and two Laredo-area salon owners:

The Governor in his announcement made a good point: it doesn't make sense to release prisoners due to COVID-19, then turn around and lock up business owners who defy shelter-in-place orders.

Then, the Texas Supreme Court decided to release Luther:

> [#BREAKING](https://twitter.com/hashtag/BREAKING?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw): The Texas Supreme Court has ordered the release of Shelley Luther, a Dallas salon owner who was sentenced to seven days in jail for contempt of court after she violated the governor’s lockdown order ([@wfaa](https://twitter.com/wfaa))  https://twitter.com/oslersctx/status/1258419088696774659

Now it's important to note that she wasn't in jail because she violated the Governor's executive order, nor does his amendment exonerate her. She violated a judge's order, at least according to this:

> This doesn't affect Shelley Luther, a jail spokesman just told me. Luther is in jail for contempt of court because she violated a judge's order. She's not in jail for violating the governor's executive order.  https://twitter.com/lmcgaughy/status/1258404594583035904

Make sense? No word on if authorities will rescind the fine.

With the excitement of the [Blue Angels' flyover](/covid-chronicles/may-6) yesterday, I missed this:

> The NBA has informed all of its franchises that their facilities may open on Friday and be used on a voluntary basis by up to four individual players, as long as local or state guidelines are followed.
