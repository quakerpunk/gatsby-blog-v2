There’s two ways to look at this:

1. She’s an idiot who got what she deserved and isn’t it delicious irony that the Governor announces the day she can open her salon, she receives her sentence.
2. Look, she’s had bills mounting and it wasn’t feasible for her to keep her doors closed. She took a big risk and it didn’t pay off, but it won’t be a long stay in jail.
