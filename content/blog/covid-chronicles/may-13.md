A reminder:

> There's still a belief only older people catch the virus. While they're a high % of hospitalizations, that's not true  
>  
> 45% of Dallas Co cases are people 40 and younger.  
>  
> 47% of Tarrant Co cases have been people 44 and younger.  
The counties separate the data differently
