Okay, there's a lot to discuss.

We've been taking it on the chin over the past week and we set a record high for new cases today. Even the governor took notice and on Wednesday, paused the state's reopening plans.

But news moves fast and the Governor's office just announced that we're having to roll back some reopening steps.

> - Rafting and tubing businesses must close

Churches and other religious services may continue to operate at full capacity.

I doubt we'll end up on full lockdown again, since no one is going to do that a second time.
