This article sums up my view on staying home vs. **carefully opening up** nicely...[Quarantine Fatigue is Real](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/05/quarantine-fatigue-real-and-shaming-people-wont-help/611482/?utm_source=facebook&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=share)

> The United States urgently needed to flatten the curve and buy time to scale up health-care capacity, testing, and contact tracing. But quarantine fatigue is real. I’m not talking about the people who are staging militaristic protests against the supposed coronavirus hoax. I’m talking about those who are experiencing the profound burden of extreme physical and social distancing. In addition to the economic hardship it causes, isolation can severely damage psychological well-being, especially for people who were already depressed or anxious before the crisis started. In a recent poll by the Kaiser Family Foundation, nearly half of Americans said that the coronavirus pandemic has harmed their mental health.

The superintendent for Dallas ISD is exploring all options for getting kids back to school...including this peculiar idea

> Superintendent tells me one plan being considered for DISD: bring ALL elementary students back to classrooms, possibly spread out in larger middle schools. They’re too young to be home alone. Secondary students would do more distance learning from home [#wfaa](https://twitter.com/hashtag/wfaa?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) [#disd](https://twitter.com/hashtag/disd?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) [pic.twitter.com/zszHGaA6qN](https://t.co/zszHGaA6qN)

Very good news from the Governor's Mansion:

> Texas governor announces $1-billion in food benefits for families of school kids who've lost access to free or discounted meals at school because of [#COVID19](https://twitter.com/hashtag/COVID19?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw).

Our behavior during this unprecedented age that we find ourselves in is messing with the robots that enhance our lives. [Our weird behavior during the pandemic is messing with AI models](https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/05/11/1001563/covid-pandemic-broken-ai-machine-learning-amazon-retail-fraud-humans-in-the-loop/?fbclid=IwAR0gAshW3-URTcPtE9pJEs35_zlgpUbSEOxlW7vowHQtIQEzZc62D8oH0lA)

> What’s clear is that the pandemic has revealed how intertwined our lives are with AI, exposing a delicate codependence in which changes to our behavior change how AI works, and changes to how AI works change our behavior. This is also a reminder that human involvement in automated systems remains key. “You can never sit and forget when you’re in such extraordinary circumstances,” says Cline.

Maybe the robot revolution has a few bugs to work out.
