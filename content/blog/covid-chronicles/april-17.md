### April 17

- Total Cases in North Texas: 4,716 (+253)
- Total Deaths in North Texas: 123 (+8)

The bad news? Thatâ€™s the biggest 1-day jump so far.  The good news?

> Cases continue to grow each day; however, log scale shows it is taking longer for case numbers to double. Something to watch!

If you read [yesterday's post](april-16), you'll recall that we're now required to wear masks and I mentioned it's a head scratcher. Well, things became more clear after an emergency meeting by the County Commissioners this morning. [They voted 3-2](https://www.dallasnews.com/news/public-health/2020/04/17/dallas-county-commissioners-vote-to-scale-back-county-wide-mask-order-reopen-crafts-stores/) to clarify that no one will be fined or incur the wrath of law enforcement if they don't wear a mask. It's still a good idea, so good in fact the Commissioners also voted to reopen craft stores to allow folks to buy the materials needed for homemade masks.

Yes, you heard me right. Craft stores are now essential businesses.
