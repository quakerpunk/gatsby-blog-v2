So, yesterday's news about the record number of deaths across the state comes with a caveat:

> Per [@TexasHHSC](https://twitter.com/TexasHHSC), high # result of reporting in one day of backlogged tests from a large lab that had been having tech issues. This is why they use 7-day average: Positivity rate (previous 7 days) = New cases (previous 7 days) / New test results (previous 7 days).
