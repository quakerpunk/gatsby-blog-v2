### April 15

- Total Cases in North Texas: 4,223
- Total Deaths in North Texas: 101

> More testing news. [@Walgreens](https://twitter.com/Walgreens) will open two North Texas testing sites at 2060 S Buckner Blvd in Dallas and 8600 Camp Bowie West in Ft Worth! Sites won’t be ready for several days. Once operational, each site will provide 160 free test per day.
