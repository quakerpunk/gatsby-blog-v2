### April 28

-  Dallas County: 3,240 total cases, 135 new cases and 10 deaths.
-  That ties the deadliest day so far and sets a record for new reported cases.

> Remember, the Governorâ€™s orders may change but the underlying science will not. I strongly recommend everyone take their advice from the [@CDCgov](https://twitter.com/CDCgov) and local health authorities as to what is safe for them, their families and our broader community.

Museums are among the establishments that may open their doors starting Friday. The Dallas Museum of Art won't be one of those.

> We are aware of the inclusion of museums in the state's phase one plan to re-open. With the health and safety of our visitors and staff as our top priority, the DMA will not re-open on May 1. We will confirm a re-opening timeline as soon as we determine that we can do so with the proper measures in place.

Per this [Facebook annoucement](https://www.facebook.com/DallasMuseumofArt/posts/10158062104613467?__xts__[0]=68.ARDO0XXsSA0fsUkxdGVi6Zqj3NDX2A0Pi7GSGUbHaosFXqt170yIdazdbAJwCJKSdqTKQSbud61KzEvh5OEV5ls3hW07fycM-4gftBQoJeF4ejzmOG91DQ_meg-os2uYsW_BKDQGGQyf9FazZXc2Xz95FXhMpCIQ2ArIujCHssSfWDQT-tP2qf0LpryPZZk8Aw6pjPBj-3ag8eicJJ3p22mI16PY2saZ8xA8WJQu0Y8ThOXsX1wTzGfJlB9q8xKrAsFV2UBo0uJx9ZruPo93ekS2q8mKpMOMmT7V9gCnMhC4xrEIxv7LFK8LbmdEQjAwaTsUXVmuYq76yg&__tn__=-R)

The museum's restaurant, Musume, **will** be open for dine-in and curbside pickup.

Well, then I'll need to hack it. But for those cold nights going to and from the game, definitely. #victorygreenninja

Some observations from today's grocery store run:

1. The number of people wearing masks, which is mandatory mind you, was about 70-80%.
1. I saw plenty of food on the shelves. I'm not sure if that will always be the case, with [hushed whispers](https://www.nationalreview.com/the-morning-jolt/eat-more-potatoes-america/?fbclid=IwAR1Ockk10X4Q1Z-WEyEvat4JFXBdxPCR4Nwz-RWFz9b5BnJ4xYSz6n7lcsE) about our food supply chain. If you've been thinking about stocking up, I'd go now.
1. I think grocery stores can play a bigger role. Say there's a contest to choose one shopper or family each 24-hour period and give them their haul for free. There's one catch: you have to be wearing a mask. That would get people to comply.
