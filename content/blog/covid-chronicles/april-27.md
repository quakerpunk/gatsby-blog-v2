### April 27

-  Dallas County: 91 new cases and 2 deaths. 

Big day today. Governor Greg Abbott has announced a plan to start opening Texas back up.

Left out of the plan: bars, gyms, hair salons, but Gov. Abbott is planning on having them open mid-May.

There’s not much the judge can do since the Governor’s order takes precedence. 

As for me, I’m waiting and seeing. A lot of folks are suffering from “quarantine fatigue.” They could use the distraction. But we need accurate testing to ensure we’re not giving the virus more room to breed. And we need to keep people aware of social distancing, wearing masks, things like that. I can tell you that since we’ve had to wear masks in public, folks have **not** been keeping their distance. My fear is they may take this order as an all-clear when it’s really not.

Meantime, I understand people are suffering because they can’t work, that their businesses were shut down and that this gives them the opportunity to provide for their families again. That will be a relief. 

My family and I are still being careful. I suspect we’ll be more willing to venture out by August, barring any setbacks.
