### April 6

Today, Dallas County announced 43 more Coronavirus cases.

Our county judge, Clay Jenkins, and our governor, Greg Abbott, are quarreling over opening a 250-bed makeshift hospital at the Kay Bailey Hutchison Convention Center.

Over the weekend, the Texas National Guard showed up to help out the North Texas Food Bank with distributions.
