~~Probably should wear a mask.~~

Actually, now you have to. [Gov. Greg Abbott requires masks statewide to fight COVID-19, limits size of gathering](https://www.dallasnews.com/news/public-health/2020/07/02/gov-greg-abbott-requires-masks-statewide-to-fight-covid-19-limits-size-of-gatherings/)

> The move marks a major reversal for Abbott, who in April blocked local officials from penalizing [people who don’t wear masks](https://www.texastribune.org/2020/04/27/harris-face-masks-fine-texas-coronavirus/), undermining their efforts to require face coverings in public. Those who don’t follow Abbott’s latest order first face a warning, and then fines of up to \$250 for any additional offense.
