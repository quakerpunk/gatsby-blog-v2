How unprecedented is this?

> **Is this the first time the State Fair of Texas has been canceled?**
> No; This will be the eighth Fair in our 134-year history that has been canceled. The State Fair of Texas has previously canceled Fairs because of World War I (1918), planning for the 1936 Texas Centennial Exposition and 1937 Pan American Exposition at Fair Park (1935 – 1937), and World War II (1942 – 1945).

Other events, as of right now, are still scheduled to go on, such as the Prairie View A&M-Grambling and Texas-OU football games.
