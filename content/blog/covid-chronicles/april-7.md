### April 7

#### First, the bad news:

50 people have died from the Coronavirus in North Texas. Dallas County has recorded 106 new cases and its 19th death. 

Singer-songwriter John Prine has succumbed to COVID-19. 

100 American Airlines flight attendants have tested positive for the Coronavirus. 

#### And now, the good news:

A local teen, claiming to be COVID-19 positive, has been arrested on charges of making Terroristic Threats. She suggested on social media that she was intentionally spreading the virus. 

And just remember...

> Something good is going to come out of this season. If you asked me to prove it, I couldn't. Not yet anyway. I don't have evidence. All I have is faith, this small, barely there at times, glimmer of belief. But that's more than enough for today. (Expect to see this tomorrow too!)
