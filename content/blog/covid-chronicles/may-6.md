### May 6

- Dallas County: 4,869 total cases, 246 new cases, and 2 more deaths.

The numbers went down slightly today.

I scrolled through on my Facebook feed this morning. Two different people, who I don't think have ever met, posted the same video from YouTube. I guess it offers a different take on the pandemic, as one of those friends called Dr. Fauci a fraud.

I need convincing. Our numbers spiked recently and we've set new records for the number of positive cases. But I get it. There's as much anxiety with opening and the health issues that would present, with not opening and risking missed mortgage payments and rent, and not being able to make ends meet. Some business transactions can't happen over Zoom.

I’d like to see more testing before opening up more. Stay safe out there, everyone.

Today was Dallas' turn for a flyover from the [Blue Angels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Angels). I felt I would be too far east of the flight path to see them and it turns out I was right. But some of our local news folk caught video:

Attention, artists. Developers, you too:

> In times of crisis, the skills of storytelling and art-making become even more important, not less. Dear artist, don't pivot. Don't adapt. Don't merely change with the times. Focus on your true work. Find what your greatest gift is, and offer that to the world.
