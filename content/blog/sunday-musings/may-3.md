I was listening to the [latest Ransomed Heart podcast](https://www.ransomedheart.com/rhplay/podcast/needed-shaking), the second in a series discussing the COVID-19 pandemic, and John Eldredge asked a question at the end that I want to share with you:

> Would [the friends of Jesus Christ] exchange a few years of suffering for the greatest awakening the world has ever known, followed by the return of Jesus?

Honestly, I’m not sure how I’d answer this one.
