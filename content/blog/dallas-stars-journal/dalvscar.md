title: Dallas Stars vs. Carolina Hurricanes

### Preview

That bunch of jerks blow into town for their only visit to the AAC tonight.

Thought they have the same number of points as the Stars, at 67, the Carolina Hurricanes find themselves on the cusp of a Wild Card berth. A win tonight would surely go a long way towards achieving that end.

One player to watch out for is number 20, Sebastian Aho, who is on a five-game goal-scoring streak. Keeping him contained will be crucial if the Stars want to grab the two points tonight.

Khudobin is in net for Dallas, Mrazek is on for the Canes.

### Post-Game Thoughts

These are the kind of games that making coming out in a cold night worthwhile. A solid effort from opening face off to the final horn. And a hat trick to boot

Sure, Khudobin has to be stellar at times and the only goal to get past him was a fluke, but thatâ€™s the only negative things I can find about this one.

So after not scoring against them at all last season, the Stars pin their ears back and disperse the Hurricanes.

### Three Stars

1. Jamie Benn
2. Miro Heiskanen
3. Denis Gurianov
