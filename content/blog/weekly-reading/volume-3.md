[QAnon Woke up the Real Deep State | Arc Digital](https://arcdigital.media/qanon-woke-up-the-real-deep-state-72bbfcb79488)

> You cheered on lawyers who said they’d release the Kraken. But now you’ve poked Leviathan.

Bruh.

[MAGA-land’s Favorite Newspaper | The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2021/01/inside-the-epoch-times-a-mysterious-pro-trump-newspaper/617645/)

> *The Epoch Times* is unreservedly pro–Donald Trump, and coverage of the newspaper tends to portray it as either a recent entrant into the Trumpist media stable or a case study of Facebook-enabled misinformation. To an extent, it is both. Following Joe Biden’s election as president, the newspaper reconstituted itself into a vehicle for esoteric voter-fraud allegations.

An exposé of *The Epoch Times*, a paper I figured was right-wing before I read this article. I’m still sincerely trying to find a good right-leaning media outlet.

[Ben Shapiro’s Playbook | Arc Digital](https://arcdigital.media/ben-shapiros-playbook-6f76470b8bdc)

> In order to believe this, one must believe Shapiro’s brand of culture war belligerence is the only form of conservatism around. *Politico* is a publication, mind you, that regularly publishes *National Review’s* Rich Lowry to little blowback. It’s not as if there aren’t conservatives, even red-blooded ones, who could slot in as guests in their pages without incurring this much backlash. Knowles wants you to believe to denounce Shapiro is to denounce conservatism itself.

Weird move by *Politico*, but as they say, there’s no such thing as bad press.

[EFF's Response to Social Media Companies' Decisions to Block President Trump’s Accounts | EFF.org](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/01/eff-response-social-media-companies-decision-block-president-trumps-accounts)

> The decisions by Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, and others to suspend and/or block President Trump’s communications via their platforms is a simple exercise of their rights, under the First Amendment and Section 230, to curate their sites. We support those rights. Nevertheless, we are always concerned when platforms take on the role of censors, which is why we continue to call on them to apply a [human rights framework](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/11/eff-court-remedy-bad-content-moderation-isnt-give-government-more-power-control) to those decisions.

David French examines Christianity in light of Southern shame culture.

[Where Does the South End and Christianity Begin? | The Dispatch](https://frenchpress.thedispatch.com/p/where-does-the-south-end-and-christianity)

A couple of pull quotes...

> We experience this reality constantly. It sometimes appears as if the bulk of the conservative media economy is built around finding and highlighting leftist insults, leftist disrespect, and leftist contempt.

> In the South, this conflict between Gospel truth and human rebellion is reflected in the debate as to whether much of the South is merely “Christ-haunted” as opposed to “Christ-transformed.” There is no question that the South is religious—often very religious. But how much has that religion changed human hearts?

[A thread on probabilistic thinking](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1332340450372575234.html)

> Probability is about more than the odds. It’s about how we weigh our knowledge, the methods in which we use to deal with our ignorance, and understanding that in the real world the range of outcomes is rarely finite.
