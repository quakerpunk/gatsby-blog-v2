[Discovering WW1 tunnel of death hidden in France for a century | BBC News](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-56370510)

> Not since the 1970s has there been such an important discovery from the Great War in France. In woods on a ridge not far from the city of Reims, the bodies of more than 270 German soldiers have lain for more than a century - after they died the most agonising deaths imaginable.

Despite opposition, a father-and-son team play amateur archaeologists and hit upon a major discovery.

[Japan emerges as backgammon powerhouse in the world | SoraNews24](https://soranews24.com/2021/03/15/japan-emerges-as-a-backgammon-powerhouse-in-the-world/)

> What makes this team’s victory extra special is that none of Japan’s top players were even on it. There is said to be only 200,000 competitive backgammon players in Japan compared to a global total of 300 million — which amounts to about 0.06 percent — and yet three Japanese players can be found in the worldwide top ten: first place Masayuki “Mochy” Mochizuki, Second place Michihito “Michy” Kageyama, and Sixth Place Akiko Yazawa.

I haven't played backgammon in a long time.

[*Justice League*’s Snyder cut review: No longer Whedonesque—and all the better | Ars Technica](https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/03/justice-leagues-snyder-cut-review-no-longer-whedonesque-and-all-the-better/)

> Snyder was clearly building up to something huge with *Justice League*—a crystallization of the dark-superhero ethos he had been creating piecemeal, now buttressed by a more rounded-out cast of massive egos—so it's interesting to not only see his vision come to fruition, but also to compare it to what Joss Whedon pieced together when Snyder left the original production cycle due to a personal tragedy. As imperfect as this cut of Justice League is, it is better than [Whedon's directorial vision](https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/11/justice-league-review-who-will-avenge-these-short-changed-heroes/)—by a Krypton mile.

Following on the heels of [last week’s long piece on the Snyder Cut](volume-7), here comes the first review I’ve seen.

[TikTok wants to keep tracking iPhone users with state-backed workaround | Ars Technica](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/03/chinas-tech-giants-test-way-around-apples-new-privacy-rules)

> In the future, they will have to ask permission to gather tracking data, a change that is expected to deal a multibillion-dollar bombshell to the online advertising industry and has been fought by Facebook, since most users are expected to decline to be tracked.
> 
> In response, the state-backed China Advertising Association, which has 2,000 members, has launched a new way to track and identify iPhone users called CAID, which is being widely tested by tech companies and advertisers in the country.

I didn't sign up for a TikTok account, because I had a feeling they weren't going to be good stewards of my data. Sad to say, my fears were not unfounded.

> After months of stalling, Google finally revealed how much personal data they collect in Chrome and the Google app. No wonder they wanted to hide it.

> Spying on users has nothing to do with building a great web browser or search engine. We would know (our app is both in one). [pic.twitter.com/lJBbLTjMuu](https://t.co/lJBbLTjMuu)

[Israeli researchers announce discovery of new Dead Sea scroll fragments](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/dead-sea-scrolls-new-israel-b1817703.html)

> The Israel Antiques Authority (IAA) announced on Tuesday that fragments of a scroll had been found in a cave in the Judean Desert. The discovery came during a several-year-long survey of all the caves in the area, carried out by the IAA.

Interesting development. Seems researchers were in a race to get to the Cave of Horror before thieves could. No idea what this will mean for future Biblical studies.
