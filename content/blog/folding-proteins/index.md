Merry Christmas, everyone. 

[What is the “protein folding problem”? A brief explanation](https://rootsofprogress.org/alphafold-protein-folding-explainer)

> Today Google DeepMind announced that their deep learning system AlphaFold has achieved unprecedented levels of accuracy on the “protein folding problem”, a grand challenge problem in computational biochemistry.
> 
> What is this problem, and why is it hard?

A good primer on protein folding, the challenges involved, and, of course, recent developments.
